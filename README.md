# EAWAG
We've acquired a *lot* of tomographic scans of a bunch of [Cichlids](https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cichlid) for a collaboration with the [Department Fish Ecology and Evolution](https://www.eawag.ch/en/department/fishec) of the [EAWAG](https://www.eawag.ch/) and the [https://www.aqua.iee.unibe.ch/](Aquatic Ecology & Evolution) group of the [Institute of Ecology and Evolution](https//www.iee.unibe.ch/index_eng.html).
This set of [Jupyter](https//jupyter.org/) noteboosk was used to preparing the tomographic scans of those fishes for display and further processing of the data.
