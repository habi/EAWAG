# EAWAG
We've acquired a *lot* of tomographic scans of a bunch of [cichlids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cichlid) for a collaboration with the [Department Fish Ecology and Evolution](https://www.eawag.ch/en/department/fishec) of the [EAWAG](https://www.eawag.ch/) and the [Aquatic Ecology & Evolution](https://www.aqua.iee.unibe.ch/) group of the [Institute of Ecology and Evolution](https://www.iee.unibe.ch/index_eng.html).

This set of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks was used to prepare the tomographic scans of those fishes for checking the data, and to prepare them for display and further processing.
